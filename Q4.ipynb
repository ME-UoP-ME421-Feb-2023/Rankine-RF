        "1.   Structural Damping: Adding damping materials, such as viscoelastic materials or dampers, to the structure of the system. These materials absorb and dissipate vibrational energy, reducing the response of the system to external excitations.\n",

        "2.   Aerodynamic Damping: Modifying the aerodynamic properties of the rotor, such as adding fins or dampers, to increase air resistance and dissipate energy.\n",

        "3. Fluid Damping: Introducing a fluid (such as oil) to the system to create viscous friction, which absorbs and dissipates vibrational energy.\n",

        "Another solution to safely operate a system with an unbalanced rotor near the second mode of resonance is to implement active control techniques. Active control involves using sensors, actuators, and control algorithms to actively monitor and counteract vibrations in real-time. Here are some examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Active Vibration Control: Using sensors to measure the vibrations of the system and actuators to apply counteracting forces or moments to dampen the vibrations. This can be achieved using piezoelectric materials, magneto-rheological dampers, or other active control devices.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Feedback Control: Using control algorithms to monitor the system's response and adjust the operating parameters (such as speed, torque, or stiffness) to avoid resonance conditions. This can be done in real-time, continuously adapting the system's parameters to keep the rotor away from the resonance frequency \n",
